The following are the basic rules about style for writing Amoeba documents:

*  Use only the standard ms macros and the additions in am_macros file.

*  In fact, Do not use a troff directive when an ms macro is
   available to perform the same function.

*  Avoid personal pronouns where possible (such as "you", "he" and "she").
   Never use the first person (I/me).  Use formal 3rd person (passive voice)
   wherever possible.

*  For manual pages use the TEMPLATE file - don't alter the ordering.  Don't
   add new sub-headings unless absolutely necessary.

*  Don't use contractions (such as don't).  Spell out the full text.
   Remember that `cannot' is one word.

*  References to other manuals should give the name of the manual in italics
   and the (X) immediately following in Roman text, where X is one of:
	A - administrative man page
	H - include file man page
	L - library man page
	T - test system man page
	U - utility man page

    This effect is achieved by the following:
    .I name (X)

*  References to indiviual routines should be in italics with no () at the end.

*  Make sure that when printed the text of examples remains within the text
   margins.

*  Make sure that there is a . after the last See Also item of manual pages.

*  Start new sentences on new lines.

*  Make sure that there are no blanks on the ends of lines.

*  Code examples should be placed between .sC and .eC macros.

*  The use of .br to start a new paragraph is strictly forbidden.
   Use .LP only.  For indented paragraphs use .IP.

*  The only acceptable dingbat is the bullet \(bu.

*  Don't use double quote (") so that appears in the text except when using
   a constant width font.  Use `` and '' for open double quote and close
   double quote respectively.

*  All options should appear in bold face.  Minus signs must be "long"
   so an option should be of the form
   .B \-option

*  All environment variables should be in constant width font. (.cW macro)

*  All file names should be in italic font.

*  SPELL CHECK (American spelling, I'm afraid) the file carefully.

*  Add keywords markers for generating indices.  Use the .kW macro for this.
   Don't just place it at the front of the file but in the text near where the
   reference for the indexed word appears.

*  The first word in the summary line (ie. after the .mT) should begin with a
   lowercase letter unless the first word is normally capitalized in English.
   The should *not* be a full-stop (.) at the end of the summary line.

*  If you want a grave accent and not an open-quote use \(ga and not `.
