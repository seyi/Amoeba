This directory contains a tool definition for "cc-c" suitable to be used
with gcc version 1.36.
To avoid having to call a seperate dependency-generator, we let the gcc
frontend call the ACK C-preprocessor, which gives the information we want.

As the gcc preprocessor gets called in a non standard way, we have to
fiddle the argument list and redirect its output first.
This is done by the small program cvtcpp.c, residing in this directory.

It should be installed in directory $ACKCPPLIB (by default "/usr/local/ambin",
see cc-c.amk) under the name "gcc-cpp".  The "-B" option of gcc then takes
care of picking this preprocessor instead of the default one.

Warning: the gcc toolset is currently *unsupported*, and has hardly
been tested.  We did manage to make a working Amoeba kernel with it, though.
Note also that this toolset is specifically for gcc *version 1.36*,
which is the only version we've got installed at this moment.
Expect to run into trouble with other versions: the cpp might be given
different parameters, in which case "cvtcpp.c" must be changed accordingly.

So: use at own risk, and only if you must.
