This directory contains tool definitions to be used with "Sun C 1.0"
(aka "unbundeled") compiler.  It is actually just a minor variation
of the normal "sun" toolset.

The major difference is that we have removed the default "-O" flag
because that turned out to be "too smart" when compiling the Amoeba kernel.
So, in order to get a fast kernel, it is probably wise to use the
old Sun C compiler while you still have it.

Of course, some day we will try to track down what is really causing
the problem, and when we've fixed (or circumvented) it the -O option
will be added again.
