          ELVIS                                                       ELVIS




          NAME
               elvis, ex, vi, view, input - The editor

          SYNOPSIS
               elvis [flags] [+cmd] [files...]

          DESCRIPTION
               Elvis is a text editor which emulates vi/ex.

               On systems which pass  the program name as an argument, such
               as  Unix and  Minix, you  may also  install elvis  under the
               names "ex",  "vi", "view",  and "input".  These  extra names
               would  normally  be  links  to  elvis;  see the  "ln"  shell
               command.

               When elvis is invoked  as "vi", it behaves exactly as though
               it was invoked as  "elvis".  However, if you invoke elvis as
               "view", then  the readonly option  is set as  though you had
               given it  the "-R" flag.  If you invoke  elvis as "ex", then
               elvis will start up in the colon command mode instead of the
               visual command  mode, as  though you  had given it  the "-e"
               flag.  If you invoke  elvis as "input" or "edit", then elvis
               will start  up in  input mode, as  though the "-i"  flag was
               given.

          OPTIONS
               -r   To the  real vi, this  flag means that  a previous edit
                    should  be recovered.   Elvis, though,  has  a separate
                    program, called elvrec(1),  for recovering files.  When
                    you invoke  elvis with -r,  elvis will tell  you to run
                    elvrec.

               -R   This   sets  the  "readonly"   option,  so   you  won't
                    accidentally overwrite a file.

               -t tag
                    This causes elvis to start editing at the given tag.

               -m [file]
                    Elvis will search through file for something that looks
                    like an  error message from  a compiler.  It  will then
                    begin editing  the source  file that caused  the error,
                    with the cursor sitting on the line where the error was
                    detected.  If  you don't  explicitly name a  file, then
                    "errlist" is assumed.

               -e   Elvis will start up in colon command mode.

               -v   Elvis will start up in visual command mode.

               -i   Elvis will start up in input mode.

          ELVIS                                                       ELVIS



               -w winsize
                    Sets the "window" option's value to winsize.

               +command or -c command
                    If you use the +command parameter, then after the first
                    file is loaded command is executed as an EX command.  A
                    typical example would  be "elvis +237 foo", which would
                    cause elvis to start editing foo and then move directly
                    to line  237.  The "-c  command" variant was  added for
                    UNIX SysV compatibility.

          FILES
               /tmp/elv*
                    During editing, elvis  stores text in a temporary file.
                    For UNIX, this file  will usually be stored in the /tmp
                    directory,  and  the  first  three characters  will  be
                    "elv".  For  other systems, the temporary  files may be
                    stored someplace else; see the version-specific section
                    of the documentation.

               tags This is the database  used by the :tags command and the
                    -t  option.   It is  usually  created  by the  ctags(1)
                    program.

               .exrc or elvis.rc
                    On  UNIX-like systems,  a file  called ".exrc"  in your
                    home directory is  executed as a series of ex commands.
                    A file by the same  name may be executed in the current
                    directory,  too.   On   non-UNIX  systems,  ".exrc"  is
                    usually an invalid file name; there, the initialization
                    file is called "elvis.rc" instead.

          ENVIRONMENT
               TERM This  is  the  name of  your  terminal's  entry in  the
                    termcap or terminfo database.  The list of legal values
                    varies from one system to another.

               TERMCAP
                    Optional.  If your system uses termcap, and the TERMCAP
                    variable is unset, then
                     will    read   your    terminal's   definition    from
                    /etc/termcap.  If  TERMCAP is set to  the full pathname
                    of a file (starting with  a '/') then  will look in the
                    named file instead  of /etc/termcap.  If TERMCAP is set
                    to a  value which  doesn't start  with a '/',  then its
                    value is assumed to  be the full termcap entry for your
                    terminal.

               TERMINFO
                    Optional.   If  your  system  uses  terminfo,  and  the
                    TERMINFO variable is unset, then
                     will read your terminal's definition from the database
                    in the /usr/lib/terminfo database.  If TERMINFO is set,
                    then  its value  is used  as the  database name  to use

          ELVIS                                                       ELVIS



                    instead of /usr/lib/terminfo.

               LINES, COLUMNS
                    Optional.  These  variables, if set,  will override the
                    screen  size values given  in the  termcap/terminfo for
                    your terminal.   On windowing  systems such as  X,  has
                    other  ways  of determining  the  screen  size, so  you
                    should probably leave these variables unset.

               EXINIT
                    Optional.   This variable  can hold  EX  commands which
                    will be executed before any .exrc files.

               SHELL
                    Optional.   The SHELL variable  sets the  default value
                    for  the "shell" option,  which determines  which shell
                    program is  used to perform wildcard  expansion in file
                    names,  and also  which is used  to execute  filters or
                    external programs.   The default value  on UNIX systems
                    is "/bin/sh".

                         Note:  Under  MS-DOS,   this  variable  is  called
                    COMSPEC instead of SHELL.

               HOME This variable  should be set  to the name  of your home
                    directory.
                     looks for  its initialization  file there; if  HOME is
                    unset  then   the  initialization  file   will  not  be
                    executed.

               TAGPATH
                    Optional.  This variable  is used by the "ref" program,
                    which is  invoked by  the shift-K, control-],  and :tag
                    commands.  See "ref" for more information.

               TMP, TEMP
                    These optional  environment variables are  only used in
                    non-UNIX  versions of  .  They  allow  you to  supply a
                    directory name to be used for storing temporary files.

          BUGS
               There  is  no  LISP  support.   Certain other  features  are
               missing, too.

               Auto-indent mode  is not quite compatible  with the real vi.
               Among  other things,  0^D and  ^^D don't  do what  you might
               expect.

               Long  lines are  displayed differently.   The real  vi wraps
               long  lines onto  multiple  rows of  the  screen, but  elvis
               scrolls sideways.

               Many  other people  have  worked to  port  elvis to  various
               operating  systems.  To  see  who deserves  credit, run  the
               :version command  from within elvis, or  look in the system-
               specific section of the complete documentation.
