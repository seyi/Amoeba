This stdio library is derived with minimal changes from the ACK ANSI stdio
library.  The changes consisted of adding mutexes to FILE structures,
that must be locked while the coresponding structure is accessed.
This was needed to make concurrent usage of stdio in multiple threads
possible.

Note: popen is in this directory because it knows about stdio internals,
but is actually compiled with libajax, not with libamoeba.
