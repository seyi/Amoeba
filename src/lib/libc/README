The libc directory is divided up as follows:

    machdep :	Contains routines which could conceivably be written in
		assembly code (for efficiency or because they can't be done in
		C).  The generic subdirectory contains the C code version which
		can be used in the absence of an assembly code version.
		The ConfDef file is done per architecture.
    
    misc :	Contains routines for stdlib things which are not in the
		machdep subtree and anything faintly miscellaneous.

    stdio :	Contains routines for the ANSI C stdio library.  Currently
		this is implemented in terms of posix system calls.

    ajax:	Contains routines needed to make the stdio library and misc
		routines work.  This in fact a partial posix emulation.  The
		rest of it is in the ajax library.  If we do a direct
		implementation of stdio then this directory may become
		unnecessary.

    time:	Contains ansi C and un*x time commands.
