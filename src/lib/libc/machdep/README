Since it is possible to write very efficient assembly language versions of
many of the routines in libc there is a 'generic' directory with C
implementations of all the routines that can be written in C.  (Some things
can only be written in assembler).  In addition there is a subdirectory
for each supported architecture.  If there is no special assembly language
version of a routine then the Amake.srclist file takes the generic version so it is
only necessary to take the subtree for the required architecture when building
the libraries.
