    Amoeba contains a comprehensive suite of test programs for verifying
    correct behaviour of most Amoeba utilities, functions and system calls.

    This subtree contains the sources for making the Amoeba test programs.
    It is a copy of the main source directory tree, so that each test
    program, x, is located in a path under this subtree that corresponds to
    the path of the source code for the thing that x tests.
    For example, ./kernel/server/bullet contains the source for programs
    to test the bullet server, since the source for the bullet server
    itself is in src/kernel/server/bullet.

    There are templates for configuring the test suite under the tree
    templates/test. 

    Under Amoeba the test binaries are typically installed under
    /public/module/test.
