This test was written by Berend-Jan Beugel.
It makes some assumptions which are not true and is therefore liable
to report errors which are not in the server but in the program.
These mainly spring from the idea that if a b_modify fails that the
b_modify has not changed the file in the bullet server's cache.
b_modify operations which are larger than 30000 bytes will in fact alter the
cache.
