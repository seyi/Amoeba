This bullet server test suite runs in two possible modes:

(1) sequential, to check for correct interface implementation
(2) parallel, to detect bugs due to parallelism between "simultaneous"
    operations from several threads.

The program allows an interactive specification of the type and amount of
tests to be performed.

This test was written by Irina Athanasiu.
